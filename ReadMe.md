## Hollow-Ai ##
### Text based RPG for 1 or 2 players ###

The Games initial specificalions when set as a piece of coursework were narrow and limited to an
earlier version of c++, no classes (only structs), only explicitly declared iterators (no auto)
and only features that we had been introduced to on the course.

The aim of this projects is to update and streamline the game, initially getting it into a more
modern format and then to add fucntionality, and fixes.

## Initial Goals ##

- Ascertain if structs are the best choice or if anything could be gained by using classes.
- Convert all loops over vectors etc to use auto or smart looping methods
- Split all functions out into dedicated header files

## Secondary Goals ##

- Try and make the map system more like I originally envisaged (no globals)
- Add the luck stat and a mechanism for escape chance percentage
- Add load/save functionality
- Maybe add some graphics, just very simple map with dot where you are or similar to start with.
- Make audio play on encounters etc.
- Add more flavour, items, enemies etc.
